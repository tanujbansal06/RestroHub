## 🧭 Overview

**Restroly** is a comprehensive digital solution designed specifically for Indian restaurants. From street-side dhabas to fine dining establishments, RestroHub helps restaurants create digital menus, accept payments, manage orders, and build their online presence with minimal effort.

The project is designed to be **modular, scalable, and production-ready**, serving as a foundation for mobile apps, web dashboards, or POS integrations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enable QR-based menu browsing
- Provide clean REST APIs for menu management
- Support scalable restaurant operations
- Serve as a backend for web/mobile clients
- Follow industry best practices (DTOs, validation, mapping)

---

## 🔄 Business Flow

Restroly follows a two-sided restaurant workflow:

1. **Public Customer View** for browsing the menu, adding items to cart, and placing orders.
2. **Admin / Manager View** for restaurant setup, menu management, order handling, and payment follow-up.

This flow is designed for contactless dining, fast order handling, and real-time updates between the customer and the restaurant team.

---

## 1) Public Customer Flow

### QR-based access

- Each table will have a QR code printed on it.
- A default QR code for **Table 0** will be placed at the counter.
- When a customer scans the QR code, the system opens a restaurant-specific URL such as:

```text
rest1.restroly.in/{branchId}?tableId=1#menuId
```

### Menu browsing and cart

- The website menu section loads automatically for the selected branch and table.
- Based on the selected restaurant and branch, a configured website template is rendered dynamically on the UI.
- The website template shows restaurant details first and then routes the user into the menu section.
- The website template can be changed by the admin either for a specific branch or as a common template across all branches.
- Customers can browse categories, view menu items, and add items to the cart.
- A cart button lets the customer review selected items before checkout.

### Language selection and AI translation

- The website template UI includes an AI translation button with a dropdown of available languages.
- English is the default language.
- When the language selection changes, the frontend sends a request to the Spring Boot backend.
- The backend forwards the request to an AI LLM along with restaurant data.
- The translated content is returned and bound back into the UI so the same menu and restaurant details render in the selected language.

### Order placement

- Before placing the order, a popup will ask for the customer’s **name** and **mobile number**.
- After confirmation, the order is submitted with the table reference and customer details.
- An order ID is generated for tracking.

### Customer notifications

- Once the order is placed, a notification is sent to the manager/admin dashboard.
- A push notification is also shown inside the web app for active order visibility.
- The customer receives a WhatsApp message with the order ID.

---

## 2) Admin / Manager Flow

### Restaurant setup

- During registration, the admin fills in the restaurant details.
- The admin can configure one or more branches for the restaurant.

### Menu management

- Add and manage food items.
- Create and maintain categories.
- Build and update menus.
- Add and manage branches.

### Order handling

- New customer orders appear in the admin dashboard order list.
- The admin can accept the order and update its status through the lifecycle:

```text
Pending -> Cooking -> Ready/Completed -> Billed
```

### Status updates and payment flow

- Every order status update is automatically sent to the customer through WhatsApp.
- When an order is marked **Completed**, the customer receives:
  - the updated order status
  - the bill amount
  - a UPI payment link for the total amount

---

## Business Rules

- Table QR codes are branch-specific and table-specific.
- Table 0 is reserved for counter orders or walk-in customers.
- Every placed order must carry customer contact details for notification delivery.
- Admin dashboard updates should be near real-time to avoid missed orders.
- WhatsApp is the main customer notification channel for order confirmation and status changes.

```
Controller → Service → Repository → Database
↓
DTOs ↔ MapStruct ↔ Entities
```

### Key Layers

    - Request validation
- **Service Layer**
    - Business logic
    - Transaction management
- **Repository Layer**
    - JPA repositories
    - Database access
- **DTO Layer**
    - Request / Response models
- **Entity Layer**
    - JPA entities
- **Mapper Layer**
    - Conversion class between entity & dto
- **Config Layer**
    - Security, Swagger, application configs

## 🧠 Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-----|-----------|
| Language | Java 21 |
| Framework | Spring Boot |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| ORM | Spring Data JPA |
| Mapper | MapStruct |
| Build Tool | Gradle |
| API Docs | SpringDoc OpenAPI |
| Security | Spring Security |

---

## 🗄️ Database Design

- PostgreSQL as primary database
- JPA/Hibernate for ORM
- Relationships:
    - Many-to-Many between **Food** and **Category**
- Schema auto-managed using Hibernate (`ddl-auto=update`)

---

## 🌐 API Structure

- Context Path: `/restroly`
- API Versioning: `/api/v1`

Example:
```/restroly/api/v1/foods```


This allows:
- Clean versioning
- Future backward compatibility

---

## 📘 Swagger & API Docs

Swagger UI is enabled for easy API testing and documentation.
```/restroly/swagger-ui.html```

Swagger is explicitly configured to respect the context path.

## AUTH APIS
```bash
# 1. Login and get tokens
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin123"
  }'

# Response:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "message": "Login successful",
#   "data": {
#     "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
#     "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
#     "tokenType": "Bearer",
#     "expiresIn": 86400,
#     "username": "admin",
#     "roles": ["ROLE_ADMIN", "ROLE_USER"]
#   }
# }

# 2. Use the token to access protected endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/foods \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..." \
  -d '{
    "name": "Margherita Pizza",
    "price": 12.99,
    "category": "Pizza",
    "restaurantId": 1
  }'

# 3. Refresh the token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/refresh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
  }'

# 4. Validate token
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/validate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."

# 5. Logout
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/logout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
